# AR-Impress-Me

Overview
-----
"Impress Me!" is an Augmented reality application centered on replicating the style of Claude Monet on a photographed scene with 3D models. It was developed using Unity version 2018.3.12f1 with a Vuforia plug-in, meant to be deployed on android devices. 

This project uses predefined AR markers to spawn 3D models in a real world scene. It then uses computer vision to create stroke like patterns on top of the scene, creating a painting like image. Below is an illustration of this:
